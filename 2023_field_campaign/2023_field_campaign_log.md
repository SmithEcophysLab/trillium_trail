Brief field day at Trillium Trail (tour and background from Susan). No measurements collected, but plot layout and general sampling approach made apparent for measurement collection to begin. Tons of Trillium apparent in plots with large enough leaves to measure gas exchange with. Anticipated measurement collection start date is tomorrow, although wintry mix/snow is expected overnight in the region. Might need to start field campaign later in day to allow snowmelt (high temperatures in lower 50s as day progresses).
