# Experimental log for the Trillium Trail mutualism project

## June 22, 2022
- received 6 individual rhizomes each of Trillium, Arisaema, and Maianthemum (18 total)
- placed rhizomes in the 20C fridge

## June 25, 2022
- planted the 18 rhizomes received on Jun 22
	- 3 L pots
	- planting mix
		- first mixed 3:1 of sphagnum peat to sand
		- then made 3:1 mix of (sphagnum + sand) to decomposed granite
			- Note: turface not available, so substituted decomposed granite
		- mix was meant to loosely follow Hale et al. 2017
	- Note: many individuals broken at petiole
	- planted under a 50% + 80% shade cloth (2 layers)
	- planted on table next to cooling pads to reduce heat stress
	- pots labeled as TRER, ARTR, and MARA with numbers 1-6

## October 07, 2023
 - Kelly drives to Norman, OK to pick up 45 plants (15 each species) from Seth Wyckoff (Kivlin Lab manager)
 - Split-pot prototype intercepted

## October 08, 2023
 - Kelly places all plants in chamber "4" in ESB I basement. Chamber set to 22degC, humidity uncontrolled but hovering around 77% RH. Light banks set up on October 11, 2023 on a 12-hr light/dark photoperiod

## October 10, 2023
 - Snehanjana and Kelly move rhizomes from greenhouse (from 2022) to same chamber as new rhizomes collected on Oct. 07. Idea was to keep conditions constant between new and old plant groups

 - No guidance given for watering, only "by the heart". Attempt made at saturating soil to field capacity, but no direct measurement of this
